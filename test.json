All you need to do is pick a theme to decide how it looks.\nThere are lots of Jekyll themes out there, but we don't just want you to pick an existing one - we want to teach you how to build your own.\nI'm absolutely thrilled to announce Tonic, a You Ship, We Ship about building Jekyll themes. :test_tube:\n\nBuilding a theme is hard, but Tonic is designed to make it easy. Inside, you'll meet Mutant, a little smiley who's ready to guide you from start to finish with a list of bite-sized tasks. By the time you're finished, you'll have made a beautiful Jekyll theme and published it for the world to see. :ms_starry_eyes:\nIf you've already made a website with Boba Drops :boba-drops: or Swirl :swirl:, this is the perfect YSWS for you, as creating a theme will present new challenges and get you to use different tools.\n\nBut what else is in it for you?\n:billed_cap: If you publish a theme with Tonic, we'll send you a Hack Club hat (example pictured). We've never made these on a large scale before - only <@U041FQB8VK2|Thomas>, <@U0261EB1EG7|Deven> and I are known to have anything like it.\n:tw_question: If you publish something really awesome, we have something to invite you to. Tonic is designed to teach you the basics, but we want to encourage you to go further. If you add :five: features to your theme that Tonic doesn't explicitly teach you about, you'll get an invite to an AMA with Tom Preston-Werner, the creator of Jekyll and founder of GitHub.\n\nTonic launches now with a list of 8 tasks, and more tasks will become available in 72 hours.\nGet started at <https://tonic.hackclub.com>. :white_heart:",

I love the journey of building things, I love sharing my journeys, and I love seeing the journeys that other hackers share. So today we're launching signups for a ten-day event that's all about those journeys. Here's how it works:\n\n1. <https://journey.hackclub.com|Sign in> and create a project to work on for the next week :workworkwork:\n2. Share updates on your project as you work (we recommend 1+ per day) :camera_with_flash: \n3. At the end of the event, everybody votes to select the best journeys :white_check_mark:\n\nWe want to see text, images, and videos that tell the story of whatever it is you're building (you could even use <#C08MC7PQ40G> to make a timelapse if you're feeling spicy :eyes:). TBH it's a lot like Scrapbook, except you post your updates in <#C08MTLF071T>. Your project could be something new, it could be something you've worked on for years. Could be a solo or a group project. The only rule is that you need to ship something by the end; a demo video, a deployed website, a song, anything that lets the rest of us experience your project (without downloading or installing anything).\n\nWe'll be using head-to-head matchups like in High Seas to find the crowd-favorite hacker journeys. Everyone who ships a project with ten or more updates spread across five or more days will get at least a $15 Amazon credit\u2014but the higher you rank, the more you will earn, so make sure to tell a good story!\n\nAlright, that's it. Go forth, <https://journey.hackclub.com|sign in>, and create your project now to reserve your spot. The Journey begins on Tuesday, April 15th",
